   Base class for device connections, this is mostly for connections to the 
   robot or simulator but could also be used for a connection to a laser
   or other device

   Note that this is mostly a base class, so if you'll want to use one of the
   classes which inherit from this one... also note that in those classes 
   is where you'll find setPort which sets the place the device connection
   will try to connect to... the inherited classes also have an open which
   returns more detailed information about the open attempt, and which takes 
   the parameters for where to connect
