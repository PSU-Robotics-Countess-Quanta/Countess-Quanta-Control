Countess-Quanta-Control
=======================

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this document is to describe the functionality of the Countess Quanta robot and to help new developers in becoming familiar with the robotâ€™s hardware and software systems. This document starts by describing the robot hardware components and the key software features. It then provides instructions on how to connect to the main hardware components individually, using their own development tools. Next, it describes how to build the CountessQuantaControl software and use this to control the robot. The CountessQuantaControl software structure is then discussed, along with how to add new features to the code. Finally, a list of future development tasks is presented, to provide some ideas for future hardware and software work. As the robot is modified and as new features are developed, this document should be updated to include these changes.</p>
